It was the annual Christmas Luncheon at the Khumalo’s—a cherished tradition known for its sumptuous meals and heartfelt
family reunions at Gogo’s house in Soweto. The air was electric with excitement as relatives, friends, and neighbors
gathered beneath bright decorations and the warm glow of a late December afternoon. Laughter mingled with nostalgic
stories, and every table brimmed with festive delights.

However, just moments before the much-anticipated lunch was to be served, calamity struck. Gogo, the beloved matriarch
and keeper of secret family recipes, discovered that her prized scones had vanished without a trace. Not a single crumb
could be found. The scones, meticulously crafted using a secret blend of spices and a dash of Rooibos tea, were not
merely a dish—they symbolized the emotional heart of the family tradition. Their disappearance was no trivial matter;
it was a sweet crime laced with bitter consequences.

Rumors spread quickly through the hall. Whispers of betrayal, envy, and long-held grudges began to take shape. Each
family member harbored their own secrets and ambitions, and now, amidst the holiday cheer, dark suspicions surfaced.
Was it a playful mischief gone too far, or a calculated act fueled by jealousy over inheritance, past feuds, or unmet
expectations?
